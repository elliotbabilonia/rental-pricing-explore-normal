## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to provide the "real estate company in Taipei City" with a comprehensive analysis of the housing market to help them make informed decisions on rental property pricing. By conducting exploratory data analysis, cleaning and preparing the dataset, and building a predictive model, we aim to uncover critical insights into factors influencing rental prices. This analysis will empower our client to optimize their pricing strategy, potentially making housing more affordable and accessible in Taipei City while ensuring a profitable venture for the company.

## Project Description
As a part of NotGPT (a super real company totally not fake for the sake of completing this project), the data analytics consulting firm, I have been working on a project for a real estate company in Taipei City, Taiwan (totally real like I said ;)). The project involves analyzing and predicting rental property prices for various properties owned by the client. Here is an overview of the project, its data sources, questions, and hypothesis, as well as the data analysis, visualization, and modeling work we are using to address the problem:

Data Visualization
Generate visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
    Use summary statistics to get a sense of the dataset's central tendencies and spreads.
    Create heatmaps and geographical plots to explore spatial trends in rental prices.
    Investigate correlations between features and rental prices using correlation matrices.
Data Cleaning
    Address the issue of a column that was improperly interpreted as an "object" (string) and convert it to the correct data type.
    Identify and address oddities in the dataset, such as negative convenience store counts, which may be data errors.
    Remove or impute missing data points to ensure data quality.
Data Prediction (Modeling)
Build a linear regression model to predict the unit price of rental properties.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model validation.

This project presents several challenges, including data quality issues, feature engineering, model selection and tuning, the risk of overfitting, effective client communication, tight time constraints, and ethical considerations. To overcome these challenges, I employ strategies such as data cleaning and feature selection, model comparison and hyperparameter tuning, regularization techniques, clear client communication, project management, and ethical data analysis practices.
